What I need to mention in this README is that this porject is not perfectly done. It is due to my lack of experience in coding.
I just started to code when I joined this Codecademy Ready.

The reason I upload this though it is not done yet is I need feedback. This CSS and flexbox is a bit hard for me but I believe
if I practice for couple more hours than it is gonna be great.

Right now I feel like feedback is so important to me. Thanking you guys in advance!

Meanwhile, I an just going to revise this CSS and flexbox stuff.
